Rick wants "me-time" and send you on an adventure with Morty
Rick builds you a Morty-dex & tells you & Morty to collect a bunch of different aliens

# CRUD

C - For planets with no residents, an "unknown" alien appears and you can create them
      Alien.new(name, status [dead/alive], species) - will add to aliens table and associate current planet id, current user id, points = name.length

R - Look at previous Planets gone to & list of collected Aliens
